# DELIVERABLES:

1. Working single chip AM / FM radio
2. DMM measurements of an “unknown” gizmo
3. Set of working cables
- Two functional DuPont wires, approximately 6” long, one F/F and one M/F
- Two functional 18 AWG power cables:
  - a red one approximately 24” long with banana plugs on both ends
  - a black one of the same length as the first with banana plugs on both ends
- 5 ns (± 50 ps) of RG-58A/U cable terminated with BNC connectors on both ends
4. An answer to the question “Where is the 50 Ω in the 50 Ω cable you just made?”
5. Determination of “unknown” cable type
6. Demonstration of power supply use (video)
7. Three pictures showing the three states of probe compensation
8. Measured results showing the effects of oscilloscope probe ground lead length
9. Catalog of time / frequency domain signal pairs (measured)

        Anything else that you find interesting!

10.	Answer to the question – “How much 2nd harmonic and how much 3rd harmonic needs to be added to a sine wave before distortion is obvious to you on a ‘scope?” HINT: something in units of dBc.
11.	Plan for learning anything you’re not comfortable doing
