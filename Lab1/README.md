## Abstract: 
Passive components are devices that do not generate energy or require power to operate, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. 

## Introduction:
In this lab, the performance of passive components are measured within a frequency band. These measurements were achieved using a vector network analyzer, a device that measures signals that pass through the device under test and also the signals reflected back. Thoughout the report, the transmitted signal will be referred to as the S21 parameter, and the reflected signal will be referred to as the S11 parameter.
