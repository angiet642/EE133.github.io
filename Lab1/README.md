## Abstract: 
Passive components are devices that do not generate energy or require power to operate, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. 

## Introduction:
In this lab, the performance of passive components are measured within a frequency band. These measurements were achieved using a vector network analyzer, a device that measures signals that pass through the device under test (DUT) and also the signals reflected back from the DUT. Thoughout the report, the transmitted signal will be referred to as the "S21" parameter, and the reflected signal will be referred to as the "S11" parameter. Measurements from the VNA include impedance measurements on a smith chart in addition to the magnitude of S21 and S11 signals. All measurements are swept through a predefined frequency range to show the continuous changes of a device as a function of frequency.
