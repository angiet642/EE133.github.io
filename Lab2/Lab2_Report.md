## Abstract: 


## Introduction:
In this lab, the goal was to generate and measure waveforms from a Si5351 Clock Generator chip. To do this, we used an ItsyBitsy M4 Express microcontroller and circuit python to configure the devices. 
## Procedure
This lab required the Si5351 chip to intereface with the ItsyBitsy. Therefore, we began by soldering pin headers to the board and mounting the components on a breadboard. Once this was complete, wired connections were made between the
